## 🧰 **Pre-Workshop Setup (MUST DO!)**

> ⚠️ **Bring your laptop with the following setup ready.** No installation during workshop!

### 1. Install PHP (8.0+ Recommended)

- **Windows**: Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) → Install Apache + PHP
- **Mac**: Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) → `brew install php`
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install php php-xml php-soap
  ```

✅ Verify Installation:
```bash
php -v
# Should show: PHP 8.x.x
```

---

### 2. Install Code Editor (Pick One)

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended) + PHP Intelephense Extension
- Sublime Text
- PHPStorm (Student License Free)

---

### 3. Install API Testing Tool

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (GUI - Beginner Friendly)
- OR Use `curl` in terminal (CLI lovers)

---

### 4. Optional: Install Composer (PHP Package Manager)

```bash
# Windows: Download from https://getcomposer.org/

## 🗂️ **Workshop Structure (2 Hours)**

| Time | Segment | What You’ll Do |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 3:00 PM - 3:20 PM | 🌟 **Intro & Concepts** | Understand Web Services, REST vs SOAP, Use Cases |
| 3:20 PM - 3:50 PM | 💻 **Live Coding: REST API in PHP** | Build GET/POST endpoints, test with Postman |
| 3:50 PM - 4:15 PM | 🧪 **Live Coding: SOAP Server & Client** | Create WSDL-less SOAP service in PHP |
| 4:15 PM - 4:35 PM | 🏭 **Industrial Use Cases + Q&A** | Real examples from E-Commerce, Banking, SaaS |
| 4:35 PM - 5:00 PM | 🚀 **Hands-on Lab + Challenge** | Modify API, add validation, try GraphQL snippet! |

---

## 💡 **What You’ll Build (Hands-On)**

### ✅ REST API Endpoints

```php
// GET /api/users → Returns JSON list
// POST /api/users → Accepts JSON, returns created user
```

### ✅ SOAP Service

```php
// Function: getUser($id) → Returns "User: Alice"
// Client calls it via SoapClient
```

### ✅ Bonus: GraphQL Query (If Time Permits)

```graphql
{ user(id: "1") { name email } }
```

## 🔐 **Security & Best Practices Covered**

- ✅ Always use `HTTPS` in production
- ✅ Validate inputs with `filter_var()` or Laravel Validators
- ✅ Use `JWT` or `API Keys` for auth
- ✅ Set proper `CORS Headers` for browser clients
- ✅ Version your APIs → `/api/v1/users`
- ✅ Use meaningful `HTTP Status Codes` (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)

## 🏭 **Industrial Use Cases (Real Examples)**

| Industry | Use Case | Tech Used |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 🛒 E-Commerce | Sync products from ERP to Website | Laravel REST API + MySQL |
| 🏦 Banking | Check account balance via mobile app | SOAP (Legacy) → REST (Modern) |
| 🏥 Healthcare | Share patient records between clinics | REST + OAuth2 + FHIR |
| 📦 Logistics | Track shipment status in real-time | REST + Webhooks |
| 📱 Mobile Apps | Backend for Android/iOS apps | Lumen + JWT Auth |
| 🧩 SaaS | Integrate Zoho CRM with custom PHP app | REST API + API Keys |

## ❓ **FAQs**

### Q: I’m from non-IT branch. Can I attend?
> ✅ Absolutely! We start from basics. Just install PHP + Postman and you’re good.

### Q: Do I need prior PHP knowledge?
> Helpful, but not mandatory. Basic programming logic is enough.

### Q: Will recordings be available?
> 🎥 Yes! Slides + code will be shared. Live recording (if permitted) will be uploaded on MLSC YouTube.

### Q: Can I use my phone?
> 📱 Not recommended. You need to code and test APIs — laptop required.

---

## 🛠️ **Post-Workshop Challenges (Try These!)**

1. Add a `PUT /api/users/{id}` endpoint to update user.
2. Add input validation — reject if `name` is empty.
3. Try returning XML instead of JSON in REST API.
4. Create a login endpoint that returns a fake JWT.
5. (Advanced) Connect your API to SQLite database.
